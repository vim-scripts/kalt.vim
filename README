A cold colorscheme for GVIM/VIM without bold, italic nor
underline font styles (except for spell checking and some 
GUI elements). On VIM it uses a black background, because 
it was easier to do and *seems* to be the only way to make 
a colorscheme look nice on any darn terminal.
This colorscheme _should_ look nice everywhere.
